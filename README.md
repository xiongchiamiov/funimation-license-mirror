[Funimation] licenses anime for U.S. viewing.  As such, they block (via GeoIP
rules) non-U.S. visitors to their site - it's the easiest way to prevent people
from getting to the streams.

However, this also blocks non-U.S. visitors from viewing any of Funimation's
informational pages.  Because [Funimation has sent many C&D letters][C&D],
there is interest in seeing which titles Funimation has licensed.  Hence, this
mirror of their licensing page.
